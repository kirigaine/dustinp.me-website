        <title lang="en">Socket Squares</title>
        <description>Socket-Squares is a simple pygame application that allows users to connect to a server and see eachother move their randomly generated squares around.
		This application is a means for me to learn and use sockets without following a complete tutorial.
		I have zero experience with netcode for a "game" up until now, so systems likely have better implementations.</description>
